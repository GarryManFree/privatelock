A simple app to automatically lock your phone based on movement force, or the acceleration to be more accurate.

Private Lock can help protect your privacy and security by monitoring the accelerometer in the background and if the threshold is breached, lock the screen.

The main use cases are if your phone is taken while you're using it, or you drop your phone.
As an additional bonus, it can also help save wear and tear on your power button!

Inspired by the abandoned [https://github.com/0xFireball/PluckLockEx PluckLockEx] project, which is based on [https://github.com/SyntaxBlitz/PluckLock PluckLock].
