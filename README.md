A simple app to automatically lock your phone based on movement force, or the acceleration to be more accurate.

Private Lock can help protect your privacy and security by monitoring the accelerometer in the background and if the threshold is breached, lock the screen.

The main use cases are if your phone is taken while you're using it, or you drop your phone.
As an additional bonus, it can also help save wear and tear on your power button!

Inspired by the abandoned [PluckLockEx](https://github.com/0xFireball/PluckLockEx) project, which is based on [PluckLock](https://github.com/SyntaxBlitz/PluckLock).

## Issues
To contribute, or to report issues please use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/wesaphzt/privatelock/issues/).

### Known Issues
You will need to use your PIN code to unlock when phone lock is triggered, even when fingerprint/pattern unlock is enabled.
This is a system limitation and according to Google, a "feature, not a bug".

This is not an issue on rooted phones, however root isn't supported as of yet.

If you experience issues, please make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app.
